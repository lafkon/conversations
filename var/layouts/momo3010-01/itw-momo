there
is
one
BIG
point
i
want
to
make
graffiti
is
so
easy
to
do
..
u
only
need
a
marker
or
something
..
even
a
pencil
is
enough
and
u
are
in
the
game
..
it
takes
u
1
min.
to
buy
something
to
write
and
start
with
all
the
computer
stuff
the
entry
barrier
is
much
higher
yes,
true.
i
dont
have
to
understand
graffiti
to
do
it.
just
get
out
and
do
it!
with
gml
i
have
to
have
a
sort
of
understanding
of
xml,
i
will
need
a
comp,
internet
..
what
i
like
of
gml
is
the
way
to
document
(save)
the
tag,
keeping
the
original
still
outside!
that
is
really
cool
in
the
gallery
i
just
show
the
code
..
haha
‘keep
it
simple
keep
it
fresh’
one
thing
i
miss
too
(i
think
evan
is
not
forgetting
this
aspect)
is
the
aesthetic
of
graffitianalysis
you
mean
the
way
it
plays
out?
yes
it
is
super
nice
..
it
attracts
people.
u
see
it
and
..
wowow
i
love
the
way
it
works
with
speed,
and
these
fireworks
when
it
turns
also
the
drip
is
great
--
i
like
that
it
is
not
faking
paint
it
is
really
well
done
..
so
this
is
the
aesthetic
point
which
is
also
very
important
for
a
tag
yes.
the
digital
rendering
is
super
precise
without
trying
to
be
the
same.
no
replacement

the
germans
have
made
various
brushes
..
do
not
know
i
like
it
that
much
..
this
is
more
trying
to
look
like
graffiti
brushes
but
it
is
not
gml
is
cool
to
keep
it
raw
yeah.
it
is
sort
of
legible
in
the
way
a
tag
also
talks
about
how
it
was
done
that
is
why
we
need
data
from
outside.
the
way
the
tag
is
done
is
always
depending
on
the
outside!
what
do
you
mean?
i
said
to
evan:
look
it
is
cool
the
gml
recorder
..
but
if
i
am
in
a
room
my
tag
looks
different
then
when
i
am
outside
it
makes
a
difference
when,
where,
and
how
to
place
the
tag
is
the
place
hidden,
do
i
have
time,
is
it
crowded,
is
it
a
big
wall
..
what
i
like
also
about
all
gml
is
the
fact
sorry
you
got
disconnected
it
opened
a
whole
new
direction.
combination
of
digital
art
with
graffiti
art
..
the
two
new
popular
cultures
..
i
see
gml
not
only
as
'x,y,
time'.
it
paved
the
way
to
do
electronic
outdoor
stuff.
everybody
interesting
in
doing
something
into
his
area
is
somehow
connected
to
gml.
